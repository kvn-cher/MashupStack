</figure><br><br>

<p><i>There is an urgent need for global stakeholders to cooperate in simultaneously managing the direct consequences of the COVID-19 crisis. To improve the state of the world, the World Economic Forum is starting The Great Reset initiative.</i></p><br>

<p><b> THE CONTEXT </b></p>
<p>The Covid-19 crisis, and the political, economic and social disruptions it has caused, is fundamentally changing the traditional context for decision-making. The inconsistencies, inadequacies and contradictions of multiple systems –from health and financial to energy and education – are more exposed than ever amidst a global context of concern for lives, livelihoods and the planet. Leaders find themselves at a historic crossroads, managing short-term pressures against medium- and long-term uncertainties.</p><br>


<p><b> THE OPPORTUNITY </b></p>
<p>As we enter a unique window of opportunity to shape the recovery, this initiative will offer insights to help inform all those determining the future state of global relations, the direction of national economies, the priorities of societies, the nature of business models and the management of a global commons. Drawing from the vision and vast expertise of the leaders engaged across the Forum’s communities, the Great Reset initiative has a set of dimensions to build a new social contract that honours the dignity of every human being.</p><br>

<p><b> OUR CONTRIBUTION </b></p>
<p>The World Economic Forum has developed a reputation as a trusted platform for informed collaboration and cooperation between all stakeholders – reinforced by a track record of success over five decades. The Forum now offers its experience in building purpose-driven communities in service of the extraordinary challenge and opportunity the world faces for a “Great Reset”. The Forum provides an unparalleled platform for creating, shaping and delivering collaborative solutions for the future through its:<p>

<ol>
	<li> Hub for cutting-edge ideas, expertise and knowledge resources tools</li>
	<li> Leadership in enabling stakeholder capitalism and delivering solutions to global challenges</li>
	<li> Authority in shaping and leveraging the Fourth Industrial Revolution</li>
	<li> Status as the International Organization for Public-Private Cooperation</li>
</ol><br>

<p><b> The Great Reset Dialogue </b></p>
<p> In the run-up to the Annual Meeting, the Forum will host a virtual series: “The Great Reset Dialogues”.</p>

<p> These dialogues are a joint initiative of the World Economic Forum and HRH The Prince of Wales.</p>

<p> During these dialogues, various key stakeholders will discuss core dimensions of The Great Reset, which are as follows:</p><br><br>
